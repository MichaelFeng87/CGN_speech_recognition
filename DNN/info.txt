This folder contains scripts for running a DNN on your MFCCs or Filterbanks

files:

-dnn_data; scripts to load your dataset into train, val and test sets. You can load the whole dataset, or just create an indexing if the data does not fit into memory.

-dnn; main file where you can specify your dnn structure, loss function etc. Run this file to train as well.

Acknowledgements:

dnn was started from a Lasagne example file.
