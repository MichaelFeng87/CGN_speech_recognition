# the function to create the dictionary is based on a script by:
#  Eleanor Chodroff on 2/22/15.
# This script filters out words which are not in our corpus.
# It requires a list of the words in the corpus: words.txt

# this prepares a lexicon for kaldi
# it starts from an existing lexicon but to use it in kaldi we need
# to remove words that are not in your current database. 
# furthermore we might need to add some words that are in your data
# base but not in the existing lexicon. However the phonetic transcripts of cgn
# are not checked so a chance of errors exists and it is best to use these transcripts
# only to complete an existing lexicon.
